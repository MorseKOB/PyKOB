[introduction]
= Introduction
((Telegram)) is specifically designed for Telegraph displays (museums and the like).
It runs full-screen and presents a (simulated) telegram form. Messages received from
the wire are sounded and decoded and displayed in the body of the form. At the end of
the message, or after a configurable amount of idle time, a new form is shown, ready
to display the next message. In addition to receiving messages from the wire, messages
can also be entered on a local key or with the keyboard. These are sounded, displayed,
and sent out on the wire.

= Preface
((Telegram)) is a member of the ((MKOB Suite)) and uses the same configuration for the
Morse, hardware, and other options, either
Global or named, as ((MKOB)), ((MRT)), and the utilities do.

This user's manual covers the key and unique features of ((Telegram)), while referring to other documentation
for details on common functionality like creating and modifying configurations, selecting interfaces for
the key and sounder, etc.

== Related Components
=== pykob Package
((Telegram)) uses the *((pykob))* package(((package, pykob))) of modules. The ((pykob)) package consists of a number of modules that provide different aspects of handling code, the physical key and sounder, internet connection to a KOBServer instance, system audio to simulate a sounder or provide tone, configuration and logging capabilities, and more. When updating ((Telegram)), it is advisable to get the latest (associated) release of ((pykob)) as well.

=== MKOB (Morse Key on Board)
(((MKOB, Morse Key on Board)))
((MKOB)) is the full, graphical, user application. For most interactive use, ((MKOB)) is probably the
application to use.

There is a full, illustrated, User's Guide that describes ((MKOB)) and its operation. Please refer
to the *((MKOB User's Guide))* for descriptions of the core functionality, creating and using configurations,
interfacing a key and sounder, using the _Virtual Closer_, and more.

=== MRT (Morse Receive & Transmit - Mr T)
(((MRT, Morse Receive & Transmit)))
((MRT)) is a command-line/terminal application that is similar to ((MKOB)) in its ability to receive and send code. However, it is completely text based, allowing it to be run via a remote terminal connection to a system, or even automatically in the background (headless). It uses the same ((pykob)) configurations as ((MKOB)) (and the utility applications). In addition, it has a few options that allow it to support displays and similar applications.

There is a separate User's Guide for ((MRT)).

=== Utilities
The ((pykob)) package also includes a number of utility applications. The README file included in the package contains a short
description of each of the utility applications.

[quickstart%nonfacing]
= Quick Start

Get started with ((Telegram)) by using **((MKOB))** or **((Configure))** to set up your configuration. Copy the
example `((tg_config.tgc))` ((Telegram configuration file)) from the Telegram Documentation folder to the directory
that you are running Telegram from. Copy the `((WesternOnion-Masthead.svg))` file from the Telegram Documentation
folder to the directory that you are running Telegram from. These two files configure the look and operation of
the telegram form and provide the form masthead content.

Now launch ((Telegram)).

((Telegram)) accepts a number of command-line options. Use the `--help` option to get a description of the available options.

When run, ((Telegram)) will display incoming code as text. It accepts text typed on the keyboard and converts it to
code, which is sent to the wire (if connected). It also listens to an attached key and sends the code to the
wire, as well as decoding and displaying it. The ((Telegram configuration file)) **(tg_config.tgc)** is described in
a following section.

= User's Guide

((Telegram)) automatically connects to the wire when it is started and it remains connected
while it is running. There is no option to connect/disconnect during operation.

The exception to this is if wire number 0 is specified. In that case, ((Telegram)) does not connect to a wire,
and can be used for local (only) displays.

It monitors the wire and the local key. If the local key is opened, keyed code will be sent to the wire.
While the local key is closed, ((Telegram)) will sound, as well as decode and display, code
received from the wire.


[%nonfacing]
== Keyboard Commands
((Telegram)) automatically connects to the wire, either from the configuration or specified on the command line.
There are four keyboard commands:

1. (('~' - Open the key)).
2. (('+' - Close the key)).
3. ((ESC - Toggle the key closed state))
4. ((Ctrl-X - Clear the form (scroll the current form off)))
5. ((Ctrl-Q - Quit/Exit))
6. ((Ctrl-C - Quit/Exit))

If the key is open (either physically or by using '~'), other text typed will be sounded, displayed, and encoded and sent to the wire if connected.

(Simple, right!)

[%nonfacing]
== Exiting
((Telegram)) runs continuously once started. To stop, enter either Ctrl-Q (^Q) or Ctrl-C (^C) on the
keyboard.

[%nonfacing]
== Command-Line Options
((Telegram)) is controlled by command-line options in addition to the ((MKOB/PyKOB Configuration))
being used (a command-line option allows specifying which configuration to use, rather than
using the ((global configuration))). It is suggested that the `((--help))` command-line
option be used to get the up-to-date description of the options available. The following
list is provided for convenience.

```
usage: Telegram.py [-h] [-a sound] [-A sounder] [-g gpio] [-P serial]
                   [-p portname] [-S station] [-c wpm] [-t wpm]
                   [--config config-file] [--logging-level logging-level]
                   [wire]

Telegram - Display a telegram form with local and received messages. Telegram
specific configuration is in the 'tg_config.tgc' file.

positional arguments:
  wire                  Wire to connect to. If specified, this is used rather
                        than the configured wire. Use 0 to not connect to a
                        wire (local only).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a sound, --sound sound
                        'ON' or 'OFF' to indicate whether computer audio
                        should be used to sound code.
  -A sounder, --sounder sounder
                        'ON' or 'OFF' to indicate whether to use sounder if
                        'gpio' or `port` is configured.
  -g gpio, --gpio gpio  'ON' or 'OFF' to indicate whether GPIO (Raspberry Pi)
                        key/sounder interface should be used. GPIO takes
                        priority over the serial interface if both are
                        specified.
  -P serial, --serial serial
                        'ON' or 'OFF' to indicate whether a Serial key/sounder
                        interface should be used. GPIO takes priority over the
                        Serial interface if both are specified.
  -p portname, --port portname
                        The name/ID of the serial port to use, or the special
                        value 'SDIF' to try to find a SilkyDESIGN-Interface,
                        or 'NONE'.
  -S station, --station station
                        The Station ID to use (or 'NONE').
  -c wpm, --charspeed wpm
                        The minimum character speed to use in words per
                        minute.
  -t wpm, --textspeed wpm
                        The morse text speed in words per minute. Used for
                        Farnsworth timing. Spacing must not be 'NONE' to
                        enable Farnsworth.
  --config config-file  Configuration file to use. The special value 'GLOBAL'
                        will use the global (un-named) configuration. The
                        special value 'NEW' will use a new (defaults)
                        configuration.
  --logging-level logging-level
                        Logging level. A value of '0' disables DEBUG output,
                        '-1' disables INFO, '-2' disables WARN, '-3' disables
                        ERROR. Higher values above '0' enable more DEBUG
                        output.
```

[%nonfacing]
== Telegram Configuration File (tg_config.tgc)
While the configuration that you create and set up using **((MKOB))** or **((Configure))**, that is used by **((Telegram))**, controls the Morse encoding
and decoding, what hardware you have and how it's connected, your Office/Station name, and other aspects of the operations,
a separate configuration file, specific to **((Telegram))** controls the look and operation of the form.

The Telegram Configuration controls:

* Form (page) color
* Text font
* Text font size
* Text color
* Text bold (true/false)
* Text italic (true/false)
* Side (left/right) margin
* Top margin
* Masthead (top banner/graphic) file
* Masthead text (used if the masthead file isn't found)
* Masthead font (used for the text)
* Masthead font size
* Masthead text color
* Page (form) clear idle time
* Page (form) scroll/clear speed

The example ((`tg_config.tgc`)) file is in the ((Telegram Documentation folder))

[%nonfacing]
=== JSON Format

The ((Telegram Configuration)) file is a JSON format file, as used by JavaScript, Python, and
many other programming languages. Familiarity with JSON can be helpful, but is
not required to be able to create or modify the configuration to meet your
needs. It is suggested that you start with the provided file, as that will give
you everything you need, and you should be able to simply modify some of the
values.

[%nonfacing]
=== File is JSON Format Map/Dictionary

Below is an example file. The following sections will describe each of the value options. Although the
example is provided here, it is recommended that you use the file provided as a starting point, as
it is used for testing.

``` json
{
    "font":"courier",
    "font_bold":true,
    "font_italic":false,
    "font_size":30,
    "text_color":"black",
    "page_color":"(198,189,150)",
    "masthead_file":"WesternOnion-Masthead.svg",
    "masthead_font":"Vineta,Century725,Times New Roman,Times",
    "masthead_font_size":40,
    "masthead_text":"Western Onion Telegraph Co",
    "masthead_text_color":"(0,0,10)",
    "top_margin":30,
    "side_margin":40,
    "page_clear_idle_time":15.5,
    "page_clear_speed":1.2
}
```

[%nonfacing]
==== font
Specifies the ((font)) to be used for the messages received or entered locally. This is a font name as
found on the system. Many text editors and graphics applications provide a mechanism to see the
various fonts available on the system. This entry can also be a comma separated list of font names.
An example of that is used in the `masthead_font` entry in the file. When a list is used, the list
is scanned from left to right and the first font found on the system will be used.

[%nonfacing]
==== font_bold
Specifies whether the text used for messages should be ((bold)). The value must be `true` or `false`.

[%nonfacing]
==== font_italic
Specifies whether the text used for messages should be ((italic)). The value must be `true` or `false`.

It is valid to specify both ((bold and italic)) as `true`.

[%nonfacing]
==== font_size
Specifies the size of the text used for messages. The size is the font _((point size))_.

[%nonfacing]
==== text_color
Specifies the color of the text used for messages. This can either be a standard system color name, or
a ((RGB (Red,Green,Blue))) value. For example, the values "black" and "(0,0,0)" result in the same black
text.

[%nonfacing]
==== page_color
Specifies the color of the page (form) background. See **((text_color))** for a description of how to
specify a color value.

[%nonfacing]
==== masthead_file
Specifies a graphic file to be used for the ((Masthead))(((Masthead, banner))) of the form. Testing is
is done with SVG and PNG format files. If SVG is used, any text must be converted to paths in order to
be displayed. If PNG is used, you will probably want to use a transparent background. Other graphics
formats may work, but are not tested.

[%nonfacing]
==== masthead_font
If a ((Masthead)) file isn't specified, or the file can't be found or loaded, it is possible to specify
((Masthead text)) to be used instead. This property specifies the font to be used. See ((font))(((font, text)))
above for valid values.

[%nonfacing]
==== masthead_font_size
Specifies the font size to use for the ((Masthead text)). Not used if a ((Masthead file)) is used. See ((font_size))
above for valid values.

[%nonfacing]
==== masthead_text
Specifies the ((Masthead text)) (content) to use if a ((Masthead file)) isn't specified, or the file can't be found or loaded.

[%nonfacing]
==== masthead_text_color
Specifies the color of the ((Masthead text)). See **((text_color))** for a description of how to
specify a color value.

[%nonfacing]
==== top_margin
Specifies the space, in pixels, between the top of the page (form) and the ((Masthead)).

[%nonfacing]
==== side_margin
The space, in pixels, between the left and right sides of the page (form) and the text.

[%nonfacing]
==== page_clear_idle_time
Specified the idle time, in seconds, before the page (form) is cleared (a new form, including Masthead,
is displayed). A fractional value is allowed.

[%nonfacing]
==== page_clear_speed
Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, for the current page (form) to be scrolled off
and a new page to be displayed. A fractional value is allowed. A value of 0 will simply replace the
current page with a fresh one. A negative value will cause the current content to scroll down off
of the screen rather than up.
