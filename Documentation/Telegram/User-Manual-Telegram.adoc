[introduction]
= Introduction
((Telegram)) is specifically designed for Telegraph displays (museums and the like).
It runs full-screen and presents a (mock) telegram form. Messages received from
the wire are sounded and decoded and displayed in the body of the form. At the end of
the message a new form is scrolled into place. Or after a configurable amount of idle
time, a new, blank, form is shown, ready to display the next message. In addition to
receiving messages from the wire, messages can also be entered on a local key or with
the keyboard. These are sounded, displayed, and sent out on the wire.

[preface%nonfacing]
= Preface
((Telegram)) is a member of the ((MKOB Suite)) and uses the same configuration for the
Morse, hardware, and other options, either
Global or named, as ((MKOB)), ((MRT)), and the utilities do.

This user's manual covers the key and unique features of ((Telegram)), while referring to other documentation
for details on common functionality like creating and modifying configurations, selecting interfaces for
the key and sounder, etc.

== Related Components
=== pykob Package
((Telegram)) uses the *((pykob))* package(((package, pykob))) of modules. The ((pykob)) package consists of a number of modules that provide different aspects of handling code, the physical key and sounder, internet connection to a KOBServer instance, system audio to simulate a sounder or provide tone, configuration and logging capabilities, and more. When updating ((Telegram)), it is advisable to get the latest (associated) release of ((pykob)) as well.

=== MKOB (Morse Key on Board)
(((MKOB, Morse Key on Board)))
((MKOB)) is the full, graphical, user application. For most interactive use, ((MKOB)) is probably the
application to use.

There is a full, illustrated, User's Guide that describes ((MKOB)) and its operation. Please refer
to the *((MKOB User's Guide))* for descriptions of the core functionality, creating and using configurations,
interfacing a key and sounder, using the _Virtual Closer_, and more.

=== MRT (Morse Receive & Transmit - Mr T)
(((MRT, Morse Receive & Transmit)))
((MRT)) is a command-line/terminal application that is similar to ((MKOB)) in its ability to receive and send code. However, it is completely text based, allowing it to be run via a remote terminal connection to a system, or even automatically in the background (headless). It uses the same ((pykob)) configurations as ((MKOB)) (and the utility applications). In addition, it has a few options that allow it to support displays and similar applications.

There is a separate User's Guide for ((MRT)).

=== Utilities
The ((pykob)) package also includes a number of utility applications. The README file included in the package contains a short
description of each of the utility applications.

[quickstart%nonfacing]
= Quick Start

Get started with ((Telegram)) by using **((MKOB))** or **((Configure))** to set up your Morse, hardware, etc. configuration the
same as for MKOB, MRT, and the utilities. Copy the example `((tg_config.tgc))` ((Telegram configuration file)) from
the Telegram Documentation folder to the directory that you are running Telegram from.
Copy the `((WesternOnion-Masthead.svg))` file from the Telegram Documentation
folder to the directory that you are running Telegram from. These two files configure the look and operation of
the telegram form and provide the form masthead content.

Now launch ((Telegram)).

((Telegram)) accepts a number of command-line options. Use the `--help` option to get a description of the available options.

When run, ((Telegram)) will display incoming code as text. It accepts text typed on the keyboard and converts it to
code, which is sent to the wire (if connected). It also listens to an attached key and sends the code to the
wire, as well as decoding and displaying it. The ((Telegram configuration file)) **(tg_config.tgc)** is described in
a following section.

= User's Guide

((Telegram)) automatically connects to the wire when it is started.
The F8 key can be used to disconnect/connect during operation. However, there is no option to change wires. To
change wires, Telegram needs to be restarted with the new wire number.

The exception to automatically connecting is if wire number 0 is specified. In that case, ((Telegram)) does not connect to a wire,
and can be used for local (only) displays.

Telegram monitors the wire and the local key. If the local key is opened, keyed code will be sent to the wire.
While the local key is closed, ((Telegram)) will sound, as well as decode and display, code
received from the wire.


[%nonfacing]
== Keyboard Commands
((Telegram)) automatically connects to the wire, either from the configuration or specified on the command line.
There are nine keyboard commands:

1. (('~'  - Open the key)).
2. (('+'  - Close the key)).
3. ((ESC  - Toggle the key open/closed state))
4. ((F8   - Toggle the wire connection (connect/disconnect)))
5. ((F11   - Clear the form without showing a new Masthead))
6. ((Ctrl-A   - Advance in a new form (scroll current form up)))
7. ((Ctrl-X   - Clear the form (instantly show a new form)))
8. ((Ctrl-Q   - Quit/Exit))
9. ((Ctrl-C   - Quit/Exit))

If the key is open (either physically or by using '~'), typed text (other than '+') will be sounded, displayed,
and encoded and sent to the wire if connected.

(Simple, right!)

[%nonfacing]
== ((Indicators))
((Telegram)) displays two ((indicators)) in the bottom corners of the screen.

**Bottom Left**:

* '+' - The key is closed
* '~' - The key is open

**Bottom Right**

* '●' (filled circle) for ((Connected to Wire))
* '○' (open circle) for ((Disconnected from Wire))

[%nonfacing]
== Exiting
((Telegram)) runs continuously once started. To stop, enter either Ctrl-Q (^Q) or Ctrl-C (^C) on the
keyboard.

[%nonfacing]
== Command-Line Options
((Telegram)) is controlled by command-line options in addition to the ((MKOB/PyKOB Configuration))
being used (a command-line option allows specifying which configuration to use, rather than
using the ((global configuration))). 

The two options/parameters specific to Telegram are:

* `--tgcfg path_to_telegram_cfg_file` - Allows specifying the path to a Telegram Configuration file with
a different name or in a different location than 'tg_config.tgc' in the current directory.
* `wire`(((wire, parameter))) (as the last parameter) The wire number to connect to or '0' to not connect
to a wire. If this parameter isn't included, the wire from the configuration is used.

The rest of the options are the standard options used to override values from the (main) Configuration.

It is suggested that the `((--help))` command-line
option be used to get the up-to-date description of the options available. The following
list is provided for convenience.

```
pygame-ce 2.5.2 (SDL 2.30.8, Python 3.11.4)
usage: Telegram.py [-h] [--tgcfg tg-cfg-file] [-a sound] [-A sounder]
                   [-g gpio] [-P serial] [-p portname] [-S station] [-c wpm]
                   [-t wpm] [--config config-file]
                   [--logging-level logging-level]
                   [wire]

Telegram - Display a telegram form with local and received messages. Telegram
specific configuration is in the 'tg_config.tgc' file.

positional arguments:
  wire                  Wire to connect to. If specified, this is used rather
                        than the configured wire. Use 0 to not connect to a
                        wire (local only).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --tgcfg tg-cfg-file   Telegram specific configuration file to use. By
                        default Telegram looks for the file 'tg_config.tgc' in
                        the current directory. This option specifies the path
                        to a '.tgc' (json) file to use.
  -a sound, --sound sound
                        'ON' or 'OFF' to indicate whether computer audio
                        should be used to sound code.
  -A sounder, --sounder sounder
                        'ON' or 'OFF' to indicate whether to use sounder if
                        'gpio' or `port` is configured.
  -g gpio, --gpio gpio  'ON' or 'OFF' to indicate whether GPIO (Raspberry Pi)
                        key/sounder interface should be used. GPIO takes
                        priority over the serial interface if both are
                        specified.
  -P serial, --serial serial
                        'ON' or 'OFF' to indicate whether a Serial key/sounder
                        interface should be used. GPIO takes priority over the
                        Serial interface if both are specified.
  -p portname, --port portname
                        The name/ID of the serial port to use, or the special
                        value 'SDIF' to try to find a SilkyDESIGN-Interface,
                        or 'NONE'.
  -S station, --station station
                        The Station ID to use (or 'NONE').
  -c wpm, --charspeed wpm
                        The minimum character speed to use in words per
                        minute.
  -t wpm, --textspeed wpm
                        The morse text speed in words per minute. Used for
                        Farnsworth timing. Spacing must not be 'NONE' to
                        enable Farnsworth.
  --config config-file  Configuration file to use. The special value 'GLOBAL'
                        will use the global (un-named) configuration. The
                        special value 'NEW' will use a new (defaults)
                        configuration.
  --logging-level logging-level
                        Logging level. A value of '0' disables DEBUG output,

                        ERROR. Higher values above '0' enable more DEBUG
                        output.
```

== Telegram Configuration File (tg_config.tgc)
While the configuration that you create and set up using **((MKOB))** or **((Configure))**, that is used by **((Telegram))**, controls the Morse encoding
and decoding, what hardware you have and how it's connected, your Office/Station name, and other aspects of the operations,
a separate configuration file, specific to **((Telegram))** controls the look and operation of the telegram form.

The Telegram Configuration controls:

* Page (form) color
* Page (form) width
* Full screen or windowed
* Text font
* Text font size
* Text color
* Text bold (true/false)
* Text italic (true/false)
* Side (left/right) margin
* Bottom margin
* Top margin
* Text wrap column (typewriter bell column)
* Page (form) spacing (blank space between forms)
* Masthead (top banner/graphic) file
* Masthead text (used if the masthead file isn't specified/found)
* Masthead font (used for the masthead text)
* Masthead font size
* Masthead text color
* Welcome message (shown on completely new form)
* Display sender office/station ID (true/false)
* Page (form) advance on key opened
* Page (form) clear idle time
* Page (form) page scroll speed

The example ((`tg_config.tgc`)) file is in the ((Telegram Documentation folder))

[%nonfacing]
=== JSON Format

The ((Telegram Configuration)) file is a JSON format file, as used by JavaScript, Python, and
many other programming languages. Familiarity with JSON can be helpful, but is
not required to be able to create or modify the configuration to meet your
needs. It is suggested that you start with the provided file, as that will give
you everything you need, and you should be able to simply modify some of the
values.

[%nonfacing]
=== Entries

The file is a JSON Format Map/Dictionary. Below is an example file. The following sections
describe each of the value options. Although an example is provided here, it is recommended
that you use the example file provided as a starting point, as it is used for testing.

``` json
{
    "font":"courier",
    "font_bold":true,
    "font_italic":false,
    "font_size":30,
    "fullscreen":true,
    "text_color":"black",
    "page_color":"(198,189,150)",
    "page_width":88,
    "masthead_file":"WesternOnion-Masthead.svg",
    "masthead_font":"Vineta,Century725,Times New Roman,Times",
    "masthead_font_size":40,
    "masthead_text":"- Telegram -",
    "masthead_text_color":"(0,0,10)",
    "welcome_msg":"The Telegram App decodes and displays Morse from a Wire or the local key or keyboard. Try keying something.",
    "top_margin":30,

    "page_advance_seconds":2.2,
    "page_new_on_key_open":false,
    "wrap_columns":8
}
```

If an entry doesn't exist in the Telegram config file, the default value will be used.

**((Telegram Config Entry Descriptions))**:

[%nonfacing]
==== ((font))
Specifies the ((font)) to be used for the messages received or entered locally. This is a font name as
found on the system. Many text editors and graphics applications provide a mechanism to see the
various fonts available on the system. This entry can also be a comma separated list of font names.
An example of that is used in the `masthead_font` entry in the file. When a list is used, the list
is scanned from left to right and the first font found on the system will be used.

Default: courier

[%nonfacing]
==== ((font_bold))
Specifies whether the text used for messages should be ((bold)). The value must be `true` or `false`.

Default: false

[%nonfacing]
==== ((font_italic))
Specifies whether the text used for messages should be ((italic)). The value must be `true` or `false`.

It is valid to specify both ((bold and italic)) as `true`.

Default: false

[%nonfacing]
==== ((font_size))
Specifies the size of the text used for messages. The size is the font _((pixel))_ height (((pixel height))).

Default: 20

[%nonfacing]
==== ((fullscreen))
Specifies whether Telegram uses the full screen without any boarders, title-bar, etc.
The value must be `true` or `false`.

Default: false

[%nonfacing]
==== ((text_color))
Specifies the color of the text used for messages. This can either be a standard system color name, or
a ((RGB (Red,Green,Blue))) value. For example, the values "black" and "(0,0,0)" result in the same black
text. For anything but the ((basic colors)): BLACK, WHITE, RED, GREEN, BLUE it is suggested that a
((RGB (Red,Green,Blue))) value be used.

Default: black

[%nonfacing]
==== ((page_color))
Specifies the color of the page (form) background. See **((text_color))** for a description of how to
specify a color value.

Default: (198,189,150)

[%nonfacing]
==== ((page_width))
Specifies the width of the page (form). The value is an integer. This will be capped at the width of
the screen. For a nicer looking display, it is best to have this be narrower than the screen, so that
there is a black band on the left and right. If the value is 100 or less, the value is taken as a
percentage of the screen width.

Default: 80 (80% of the screen width)

[%nonfacing]
==== ((masthead_file))
Specifies a graphic file to be used for the ((Masthead))(((Masthead, banner))) of the form. Testing
is done with SVG and PNG format files. If SVG is used, any text must be converted to paths in order to
be displayed. If PNG is used, you will probably want to use a transparent background. Other graphics
formats may work, but are not tested.

Default: <none>

[%nonfacing]
==== ((masthead_text))
Specifies the ((Masthead text)) (content) to use if a ((Masthead file)) isn't specified, or the file can't be found or loaded.

Default: <none>

[%nonfacing]
==== ((masthead_font))
If a ((Masthead)) file isn't specified, or the file can't be found or loaded, it is possible to specify
((Masthead text)) to be used instead. This property specifies the font to be used. See ((font))(((font, text)))
above for valid values.

Default: <uses the text font>

[%nonfacing]
==== ((masthead_font_size))
Specifies the font size to use for the ((Masthead text)). Not used if a ((Masthead file)) is used. See ((font_size))
above for valid values.

Default: <uses the text font size>

[%nonfacing]
==== ((masthead_text_color))
Specifies the color of the ((Masthead text)). See **((text_color))** for a description of how to
specify a color value.

Default: black

[%nonfacing]
==== ((welcome_msg))
A message that is shown below the masthead when Telegram is started, the idle time is reached, or
Control-X is entered.

Default: <none>

[%nonfacing]
==== ((top_margin))
Specifies the space, in pixels, between the top of the page (form) and the ((Masthead)).

Default: 38

[%nonfacing]
==== ((bottom_margin))
Specifies the space, in pixels, to maintain between the text and the bottom of the page (form).

Default: 42

[%nonfacing]
==== ((side_margin))
The space, in pixels, between the left and right sides of the page (form) and the text.

Default: 28

[%nonfacing]
==== ((wrap_columns))
Specifies the number of columns from the right margin that text will be wrapped on a space (if possible). If
there aren't any spaces, the text will wrap/break at the right margin. The column width is based on the
width of a space character of the text font specified.

Default: 8

[%nonfacing]
==== ((page_clear_idle_time))
Specifies the idle time, in seconds, before the page (form) is cleared (a new form, including Masthead,
is displayed). A fractional value is allowed. Idle time is time when no code is received from the
wire or entered on the local key or keyboard.

Default: 18.0

[%nonfacing]
==== ((page_advance_seconds))
Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, for complete page (form) to be scrolled off
and a new page to be displayed. A fractional value is allowed. A value of 0 will instantly replace the
current page with a fresh one (full form without scrolling). The special value of -1 indicates that
the form is continuous, and is never replaced by a new form. If -1 is specified, the form can be
cleared using the ((F11)) key, or cleared and a masthead displayed using the ((Ctrl-X)) key.

Default: 2.8

[%nonfacing]
==== ((page_new_on_key_open))
If true, a new form is scrolled in when the key is opened (from being closed). If false, opening
the key will keep the current form and start displaying the locally keyed code. In this mode
a new form can be scrolled in using the ((Ctrl-A)) key if desired.

Default: false

[%nonfacing]
==== ((list_sender))
Specifies that the current sender's office/station ID be displayed when Telegram is started or the
sender changes. The value must be `true` or `false`.

Default: false
