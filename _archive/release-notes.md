# Release notes

## MorseKOB 4.0 (relative to MorseKOB 2.5)

These notes need to be fleshed out before MKOB is released.

### What's new

- code reader adapts to actual speed of received Morse
- can handle International Code

### What's missing

- no Preferences screen for setting options (have to use Configure utility for now)
- no support (yet) for `Basic` mode interface

### What's different

- when sending from the keyboard, typing ~ opens the wire  and + closes it
- long pauses are represented in the reader window as a long dash

### Known issues

- keyboard sender shortens spaces longer than 3 seconds to 0.5 seconds
