"""Time.py

Sends time signals to a KOB wire and/or to a sounder or speakers. The time
signals can be sent hourly, daily at 12:00 noon EST, or continuously (every
five minutes).

Optional command line parameters:
    mode - Continuous, Hourly, or Daily (can be lowercase, only need first
            letter, default: continuous)
    wire - KOB wire no. (default: no connection to KOB server)
    idText - office call, etc.

If wire is specified, then idText is required. Only sends over the wire if
someone is listening.

Serial port and audio preferences should be specified by running the
'configure.sh' script or executing 'python3 Configure.py'.

Examples:
    python Time.py
    python Time.py d 102 "Time signals, AC"

Change history:

Time 1.6  2024-03-13
- Create Internet instance with all parameters needed to adapt to new config usage
  (modules don't read directly from config)

Time 1.5  2020-05-28
- changed header to `#!/usr/bin/env python3`

Time 1.4  2020-02-13
- removed #!/usr/bin/env python header, which fails with Windows 10

Time 1.3  2019-02-13
- converted from legacy morsekob module to use pykob module
- discontinued use of separate config file
