"""SchedFeed.py

Sends messages according to a time schedule.

Serial port, code speed, and audio preferences should be specified by running the
'configure.sh' script or executing 'python3 Configure.py'.

Change history:

SchedFeed 1.3  2016-02-04
- display each character as it's sent

SchedFeed 1.2  2016-01-11
- sort msgs by time and adjust for duplicate times

SchedFeed 1.1  2015-12-30
- changed msgs element structure from list to tuple

SchedFeed 1.0  2015-12-28
- initial release
