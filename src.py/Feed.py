"""Feed.py

Waits for a station to connect to a KOB wire and sends text from a RSS-formatted
local file or news feed in Morse at a given speed, or from a PyKOB recording
json file.

If the wait parameter is nonzero, then the feed will stop sending if
another station starts sending, and will wait until the wire is idle for the
specified number of seconds before sending again.

Command line parameters (required):
    wire - KOB wire no.
    idText - office call, etc.
    URI - RSS formatted text source (URI) or a PyKOB recording file.
    wpm - overall code speed (WPM).

Additional command line parameters (optional):
    cwpm - individual character speed (default: same as overall code speed)
    artPause - delay between articles (default: 2 sec)
    grpPause - delay between article groups (default: 5 sec)
    days - number of days of articles to read before repeating, starting with
            current day (default: all)
    wait - number of seconds to wait for the wire to be idle before sending
            (default: ignore other senders)

Note: artPause and grpPause can be decimal numbers.  wire, wpm, cwpm, and
days must be integers.  idText and URI should be enclosed in quotes.

Examples:
    python Feed.py 105 "Today's News, 20 wpm, AC" "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss" 20
    python Feed.py 111 "Civil War News, 15 wpm, AC" "file://civilwar.xml" 15 18 5 20 3

Change history:

Feed 2.2  2024-03-13
- Create Internet instance with all parameters needed to adapt to new config usage
  (modules don't read directly from config)

Feed 2.1  2024-02-21
- Send text character along with the code for compatibility with CWCOM clients

Feed 2.0  2021-01-22
- Change to use standard command line argument processing

Feed 1.9  2021-01-04
- support using a PyKOB recording (json) file as a source

Feed 1.8  2021-01-04
- updated to use new PyKOB library

Feed 1.7  2020-05-28
- changed header to `#!/usr/bin/env python3`

Feed 1.6  2020-02-13
- replaced #!/usr/bin/env python header, which fails with Windows 10

Feed 1.5  2018-07-13
- include title (headline) if present (for compatibility with BBC News)

Feed 1.4  2018-07-10
- converted from legacy morsekob module to use pykob module
